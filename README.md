# Word-Guess-Game
This repository is for a Javascript game for homework due May 5, 2018. The game contains a Javascript file to run the game, an html file, and images used in the game.  The styling is created through the use of bootstrap and within the html file.  
The game is similar to hangman in that you have a limited number of letter guesses before you guess the word and the word changes to a new word.  The theme for this set of words is flowers in a flower garden.  Play starts when the html loads and the player presses a letter.
This project was created and is maintained by me, Marjika Howarth.
